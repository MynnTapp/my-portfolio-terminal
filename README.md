# Desmynn's Terminal Portfolio ðŸ’»

Welcome to my **terminal-inspired portfolio**, where creativity meets simplicity. This project is a fully script-based portfolio designed to mimic a terminal interface. It offers an engaging, interactive experience to showcase my skills, work, and personal information in a unique way.

## **Features**

- **Command-Based Navigation**: Explore directories and information using terminal commands (`cd`, `ls`, `help`, etc.).
- **Dynamic Content**: Retrieve and display dynamic content, such as jokes, using APIs.
- **Custom Theming**: Styled terminal with custom color formatting for commands and directories.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Type `home` to get started.
  - Use `ls` to list directories or `cd` to navigate into them.
  - Run `joke` to fetch a programming-related joke from an external API.
- **Built Without Frameworks**: Purely script-based implementation without dependencies like React or Angular.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the portfolio.
- **CSS3**: Integrated into the terminal-styling library for appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Core language powering the interactivity and terminal logic.
- **[jQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/)**: A lightweight library to simulate terminal behavior.
- **APIs**:
  - **[JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/)**: Fetches programming-related jokes dynamically.
